Hi there!
This is the work for Nihar Mehta and Joshua Kumar.
Implemented all the parts from PA to HD 
Used the lectorial code for reference and Gen AI for several parts of the code namely - unit tests, password validation logic and hashed passwords, setting up env file, fixing admin dashboards logic(manage users and assign courses).

our github repo URL - https://github.com/rmit-fsd-2025-s1/s4010802-s3939929-a1.git


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start by creating a new account for yourself as a tutor and then proceed by submitting an application, further you can proceed with creating a new lecturer account through sign up and check for application submitted or there are already existing tutor and lecturer account. 

you can go through all the filters and check for the bar graph at the bottom of the page.

since the passwords are hashed giving you basic login details (already created by us to test our project) : 
username: try1@gmail.com
password: Grapes@2025
profession: Tutor

username:lec@gmail.com
password: Apple@1234
profession: lecturer

Next for the admin-dashboard part you can perform 4 major functions (manage users, manage courses, manage lecturers or check for different selections through generating reports.)

The login for admin-dashboard is username:admin, password:admin
